- L24 Team 1: Karma Luitel, Benny Huang, Ayden Cline, Chen Yang

## Compilation
### Phase 1
For now our project is a  set of Database and User/Listing/Message object classes, providing functionality for reading, writing, updating, and deleting object classes from a csv file database. Just compile every class and run test cases to see how the classes function.
### Phase 2
The `client` package needs to be compiled alongside the `packet` and `data` packages. The `server` package needs to compiled alongside the `database`, `packet`, and `data` packages. Run test cases to see how the classes function.

## Database
### Database.java
- Karma Luitel
- This class provides 4 main operations and directly interacts with .csv files used as our database. It is initialized using a filename which will be used to reference the csv file it is using, and a set of String headers which refer to the columns of the database. The write method will take an array corresponding to a row of the csv file and append it to the next line of the csv file. The update method, which is overloaded, will take a header value pair to identify a specific line, and either update the value of another specified header or update the entire line, depending on which overloaded method is called. The get method will take in a header value pair identifying a line and return the original array representation of that line.  Finally the delete method will delete the line for a given header value pair.  All three (get, delete, update) methods will perform their actions on multiple lines if multiple header value pairs are found, and will also all throw a DatabaseNotFoundException if the given filename does not correspond to a valid database file. String sanitization is handled by modifying user input with quotes before writing and modifying before getting. Getters and setters also exist for the filename and header array, and all operations are thread safe. The associated interface is IDatabase.java, and the associated test file is TestBaseDatabase.java. Testing for the database class makes sure it can read, write, update, and delete lines correctly, and that it returns the correct error for an invalid database. The DatabaseWrapper class interfaces with Database to provide functionality for all other classes.
### DatabaseWrapper.java
- Ayden Cline
- This class wraps the `Database` class with higher-level functions that work with the `Table` class. The class contains methods for getting and filtering objects from the database, saving objects to the database, and deleting objects from the database.
- This is the sole class meant to be used for interacting with the database. Classes that need to use the database will call the static method `get` to get a global instance of the class and then use it as needed.
- When performing any database actions for a specific object, it first determines the class of the object and fetches the database for that class, creating a new one if it doesn't exist. When getting or filtering objects from the database, it calls `Database.get` to get the values, then maps the values to their respective objects via `Table.fromRow`. When saving an object, it first determines whether it needs to create the object or update the object. Objects with an id of 0 are assumed to not exist yet, so a new database row is created with `Database.write`, and otherwise it uses the id to update the row in the database with `Database.update`. The values to be added/updated to the database come from `Table.asRow`. When deleting an object, it simply calls `Database.delete` for the object's id, or does nothing if the id is 0 (object doesn't exist).
- The tests use the `TestTable` class created specifically for tests. The tests check that each method doesn't cause errors and that they take effect in the database. For example, after deleting an object, it attempts to get it from the database, ensuring it no longer exists. Additionally, there are tests to ensure intended behavior occurs for unexpected arguments and unintended function calls (e.g. calling `delete` twice). Lastly, there's a test that starts 5 threads at the same time, which each do heavy database work, and check everything was retrieved, saved, and deleted as intended.

## Data
### Table.java
- Ayden Cline
- This is an abstract class designed to serialize an object to a list of strings and deserialize a list of strings back into an object. The class is not meant to be used directly, hence why itâ€™s an abstract class. The class also contains an annotated id attribute, getters, and setters to be inherited by database objects.
- Any class that extends `Table` defines its own fields annotated by the `TableField` annotation and provides an empty constructor. The classes that extend this one are `User`, `Message`, and `Listing` (aside from tests).
- When serializing an object (`Table.asRow`), the `Table` class determines what fields to serialize and in what order by checking each field with the `TableField` annotation. When deserializing an object (`Table.fromRow`), an empty object is created using the empty constructor, then each attribute on the object is set according to the annotated fields and their index. Additionally, any class extending `Table` inherits a `save` and `delete` method that will get and call `DatabaseWrapper.save` and `DatabaseWrapper.delete` respectively; this is just for convenience (e.g. `user.setUsername("name"); user.save();`). Additionally, there is a method to get an array of the column names for the class, which is used in `DatabaseWrapper` to initialized the `Database` objects.
- The tests use the `TestTable` class created specifically for tests. It tests that the object is correctly serialized and deserialized, checking against expected String arrays and TestTable objects. Additionally, it checks that the columns returned by `getColumns` are correct.
### Message.java
- Ayden Cline
- This class extends `Table` and holds information about a message.
- The class holds information about who sent the message, who received it, the content, and when it was sent. Upon construction, the timestamp attribute is set to the current time, using `System.currentTimeMillis`. If an empty message is passed, an IllegalArgumentException is raised. The class also has getters and setters for each attribute.
- This class is used by the `User` class to send and receive messages.
- The tests for this class make sure that each getter and setter works as intended. It also tests that an IllegalArgumentException is thrown where it should be.
### User.java
- Chen Yang
- The User class is used to represent a user in the system. It stores and manages the user's details like their username, password, balance, and rating. The class also helps with managing the user's listings and messages.
- When a user is created, the User class requires a username and a password. Getters and setters are employed to update its fields (username, password, balance, and rating).
- The User class works closely with the Listing and Message classes, which store the actual items users want to sell and the messages they send. The DatabaseWrapper class is used to save and get all the user's data from the database.
- Testing for the User class makes sure that a user can be created with a valid username and password, that the balance and rating can be updated, and that listings and messages can be added and removed. It also checks that deleting the account works correctly and removes everything associated with the user.
### Listing.java
- Benny Huang
- The listing class sets and gets the values needed to create a lsting. It utilizes the "IListing" interface to create a set of methods that relate to listings. The class also extends the "Table" class, which allows Listing to use "id" that are obtained from methods like "getId()" and "setId()."
- Methods associated with the Listing class include: getSellerId(), setSellerId(), getSellerName(), setSellerName(String sellerName), getTitle(), setTitle(), getDescription(), setDescription(), getPrice(), setPrice(), isSold(), setSold(), toString().
- Testing associated with the Listing class mostly entails making sure the setters and getters return the right values when they are being used.
- All of this allows for the other classes, such as user or databaseWrapper classes, use the methods that are created in this listing class.
- Image support will be implemented through getImage() and setImage().
